Regarding the previous assignment, Assignment 2:

I noticed that the instructions for this assignment said to submit my git username on Blackboard. I was not instructed to submit my git username on Blackboard for the previous assignment. That assignemnt was pushed to GitHub before the due date but I have not received a mark for it yet. I don't know if other people have received their marks or not or if my assignment was missed because my username was not submitted on Blackboard. If it's just me that didn't get Assignment 2 marked, I hope that since I did submit it before the due date on GitHub that it can now be marked since you have my repository now.


Regarding this current assignment, Assignment 3:

Directory contains assignment files for the first 3 questions with the appropriate filenames as instructed as well as this README.
